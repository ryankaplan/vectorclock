# vectorclock.sk

This is a simple vector clock implementation in [Skew](http://skew-lang.org/).
It's nothing revolutionary - I'm just playing around with the language. It's
in progress and there are **definitely** bugs!

I looked at a few other implementations out of curiousity before writing this:

- https://github.com/AWinterman/vector-clock
